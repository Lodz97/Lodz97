I'm a M.Sc. student in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, and I'm currently working on my master thesis.

## My journey

- 📡 I started by bachelor as an electronic engineer
- 💻 After my first C lesson I devoted myself to Computer Science
- 🚗 Soon afterwards, I found myself coding a **[`Parking management application`](https://github.com/Lodz97/Progetto-M19)**
- ✨ During my master, I learned the black magic behind Machine Learning and **[`Deep Learning`](https://github.com/Lodz97/deep-learning)**
- 🎰 I was also taught how to gamble responsibly, thanks to **[`Bandit Algorithms`](https://github.com/Lodz97/DIA-Project)**
- 💘 Recently I discovered my passion for Recommender Systems: it was fun making **[`books recommendetions`](https://github.com/Lodz97/RecSys-PoliMi-2020)** ...
- 🏆 ... and being part of the team who won the academic competition at the **[`ACM RecSysChallenge 2021`](https://github.com/Lodz97/recsys-challenge-2021-twitter)**
- 📦 For my thesis, I'm trying to improve **[`automation in warehouses`](https://github.com/Lodz97/Multi-Agent_Pickup_and_Delivery)**
